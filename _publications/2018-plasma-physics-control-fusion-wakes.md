**Abstract:** This work presents a comprehensive theoretical and computational study of plasma wakefield evolution in non-uniform density profiles, including both density up-ramps and down-ramps. The research provides fundamental insights into wake dynamics in realistic plasma conditions with density gradients.

**Significance:** This work discovers the wake reversal phenomenonâ€”a process in which the wavelength of the wake excited in a density upramp increases to infinity and then drops to extremely short wavelengths, during which the phase velocity of the wake becomes superluminal. Other research groups later found that this process leads to the generation of narrow-band THz radiation.
