**Abstract:** Self-organization in an unmagnetized collisionless plasma refers to formation of transient coherent structures such as collective oscillations (electrostatic waves) or magnetic fields resulting from so-called kinetic effects in the plasma. This topical review provides a comprehensive analysis of the self-organization of strong-field photoionized, non-equilibrium plasmas through kinetic instabilities. The authors propose and demonstrate a novel experimental platform that enables the formation of dense plasmas with known highly anisotropic and non-thermal electron velocity distribution functions on a timescale on the order of an inverse electron plasma frequency. We then show that such plasmas are highly susceptible to a hierarchy of kinetic instabilities, including two-stream, current filamentation and Weibel, that convert a fraction of the electron kinetic energy into electric and/or magnetic energy stored in self-organized structures.

**Note:** This is an invited review article.

**Impact:** The electrostatic waves so produced are measured using a collective light (Thomson) scattering technique with femtosecond resolution as the kinetic instabilities aided by collisions eventually thermalize the plasma electrons. In addition, we describe a novel experimental technique that has made it possible to map the temporal evolution of the wavenumber spectrum of the thermal Weibel instability with picosecond resolution, which leads to the formation of quasi-static coherent magnetic fields with different topologies in photoionized plasmas.
