**Abstract:** This work reports the generation of high-quality monoenergetic electron beams in the 10-40 MeV energy range using a 5 TW, 60 fs laser system at Tsinghua University. The experiments demonstrate stable production of monoenergetic electron beams with good beam quality through laser wakefield acceleration in gas jet targets. The study investigates the optimization of laser and target parameters to achieve consistent beam generation and characterizes the beam properties including energy spectrum, divergence, and charge. The results establish the capability of the Tsinghua laser facility for reliable production of high-quality electron beams suitable for various applications in plasma physics and accelerator research.
