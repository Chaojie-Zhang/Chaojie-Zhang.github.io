**Abstract:** We show that a high-energy electron bunch can be used to capture the instantaneous longitudinal and transverse field structures of the highly transient, microscopic, laser-excited relativistic wake with femtosecond resolution. The spatiotemporal evolution of wakefields in a plasma density up ramp is measured and the reversal of the plasma wake, where the wake wavelength at a particular point in space increases until the wake disappears completely only to reappear at a later time but propagating in the opposite direction, is observed for the first time by using this new technique.

**Recognition:** This paper was selected as an "Editors' Suggestion" and triggered extensive follow-up research at international institutes.

**Historical Impact:** This work pioneered femtosecond relativistic electron probe *(first experimental demonstration)*, opening new avenues for plasma wakefield visualization.
