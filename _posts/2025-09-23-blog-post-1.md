### A Verdict on the Annual Modulation: Settling a 20-Year Dark Matter Debate

[cite_start]For over two decades, one of the most tantalizing and controversial results in particle physics has been the signal from the DAMA/LIBRA experiment[cite: 21]. Deep under the Gran Sasso mountain in Italy, its sodium iodide detectors have recorded a persistent annual modulation—a subtle, cyclical rise and fall in events that peaks each June and troughs in December. [cite_start]This is exactly the signature one would expect from the Earth moving through a galactic "wind" of WIMP dark matter[cite: 39].

The problem? No other experiment has seen it. This discrepancy, known as the **DAMA anomaly**, created a deep rift in the field. [cite_start]The results from DAMA/LIBRA contradict other direct detection dark matter experiments under the most conventional scenarios[cite: 42]. Was DAMA/LIBRA seeing the first definitive proof of dark matter, or was it an incredibly subtle, long-lived systematic effect?

[cite_start]A new combined analysis from two independent experiments, **COSINE-100** and **ANAIS-112**, has now provided the strongest answer yet: the signal is likely not from dark matter[cite: 3, 262].

### A Direct Confrontation with the Anomaly

To test the DAMA/LIBRA claim, you need an identical setup. [cite_start]This was the explicit goal of the COSINE-100 experiment, located in South Korea, and ANAIS-112 in Spain[cite: 22, 23]. [cite_start]Crucially, both experiments use the exact same thallium-doped sodium iodide (NaI(Tl)) crystal detectors as DAMA/LIBRA[cite: 44]. [cite_start]This allows for a direct, apples-to-apples comparison by removing ambiguities that arise from using different target materials[cite: 44]. If the WIMP wind is real, they should see the same modulation.

[cite_start]Independently, neither experiment saw a signal that supported DAMA/LIBRA's claim[cite: 74]. But to increase their statistical power, the collaborations took the next logical step: combining their data.

### The Combined Result: A Null Finding

[cite_start]In a new paper published in *Physical Review Letters*, researchers present a combined analysis of the first three years of data from both experiments[cite: 24]. [cite_start]By carefully modeling and subtracting the known background events from each detector, they could search the combined "residual" data for any hint of modulation[cite: 80].

The result is unambiguous.
* [cite_start]The combined data is fully consistent with a **null hypothesis**—that is, no modulation at all[cite: 160].
* [cite_start]The best-fit modulation amplitude they found was $-0.0002 \pm 0.0026$ cpd/kg/keV in the 1-6 keV energy range[cite: 31, 266]. [cite_start]This is statistically indistinguishable from zero and fundamentally incompatible with DAMA/LIBRA's reported amplitude of $0.0105 \pm 0.0011$ cpd/kg/keV in the same range[cite: 151].

[cite_start]The paper goes a step further by performing a simple combination of the newly released, much larger 6-year datasets from both experiments[cite: 211, 212]. [cite_start]This larger dataset, totaling nearly 1,000 kg-years of exposure, excludes the DAMA/LIBRA signal with even higher confidence: **4.7σ** in the 1-6 keV region and **3.5σ** in the 2-6 keV region[cite: 237, 268].

[cite_start]While this result does not identify the source of the DAMA/LIBRA signal, it "strongly challenges the interpretation of the DAMA/LIBRA modulation in terms of galactic dark matter"[cite: 262]. This finding helps to resolve a long-standing puzzle and allows the field to move forward, focusing on other detection strategies as the search for dark matter continues.
