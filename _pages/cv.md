## Research Experience

**Associate Project Scientist** | UCLA | Feb. 2022 – Present  
*Dept. of Electrical and Computer Engineering*
* Leading (PI) the ongoing E304 experiment at FACET-II, SLAC, which aims to generate ultralow emittance, high-brightness electron beams in PWFA, paving the way for compact x-ray FEL development
* Contributing to the ongoing E300 experiment at FACET-II, SLAC, focused on demonstrating a 10 GeV stage for future multi-stage plasma-based colliders
* Guiding (Co-PI) the ongoing AE134 experiment at ATF, BNL, aimed at quantifying the relative contributions of Weibel instability and Biermann battery effects to the seeding of galactic magnetic fields

**Postdoctoral Researcher** | UCLA | Feb. 2017 – Feb. 2022  
*Dept. of Electrical and Computer Engineering*
* Led (PI) the AE98 experiment at ATF, BNL, investigating thermal electron Weibel instabilities in laser-ionized plasmas using electron beams from linear accelerators as probes
* Guided (Co-PI) the AE99 experiment at ATF, BNL, aiming to demonstrate magnetostatic modes in plasmas for potential use as ultra-compact undulators
* Developed a plasma grating technique using ultra-short laser pulses, enabling precise strong-field ionization measurements and low-density plasma characterization
* Established a laboratory framework with ultrafast optical field-ionized gases and femtosecond optical Thomson scattering, exploring kinetic plasma instabilities

**Graduate Research Assistant** | Tsinghua University, China | Sep. 2010 – Oct. 2016  
*Department of Engineering Physics*
