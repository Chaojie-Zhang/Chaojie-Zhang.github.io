## Research Leadership and Experience

* **Principal Investigator** of the E304 experiment at FACET-II, SLAC, demonstrating the generation of >20 GeV electron bunches with <0.5% energy spread and ultrahigh brightness. This work establishes a viable pathway for plasma wakefield accelerator (PWFA) driven colliders and XFELs.

* **Key Collaborator** on the E300 experiment at FACET-II, SLAC, to demonstrate a 10 GeV PWFA stage for future energy-frontier colliders. Achieved up to 6 GeV energy gain for a trailing bunch while preserving its sub-percent energy spread.

* Pioneered a physics-informed **'virtual diagnostic'** leveraging machine learning (ML) to reconstruct inaccessible longitudinal phase space of femtosecond beams. This AI/ML-driven technique was a critical component of a recent Nature Communications publication and is now being adopted by collaborators (e.g., E300) for advanced data analysis.

* Led large-scale **Particle-in-Cell (PIC) simulations** on NERSC platforms to design and optimize experiments (including E304 and AE98), interpret complex beam-plasma interactions, and validate theoretical models.

* **Co-directing** the AE134 experiment at ATF-BNL, building upon the success of AE98 to investigate the interplay between Biermann battery and Weibel instability magnetic fields in overcritical density plasmas.

* **Principal Investigator** for the AE98 experiment at ATF-BNL, utilizing ultrashort electron bunches to probe thermal Weibel instability in laser-produced plasmas. This work provided the first direct experimental validation of a fundamental astrophysical plasma process in a laboratory setting.

* Pioneered the technique of **femtosecond relativistic electron probing (FREP)** for transient, intense electric/magnetic fields. Captured the first-ever snapshots of plasma wakefields, demonstrating a new diagnostic capability for visualizing ultrafast plasma phenomena.

* **Mentoring** graduate students and postdoctoral researchers in experimental plasma physics, advanced diagnostics, and computational methods. Organized and led seminars on specialized topics in plasma physics, providing both theoretical insights and hands-on training.
