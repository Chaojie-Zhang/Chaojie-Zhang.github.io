I'm Chaojie Zhang, an experimental plasma physicist at UCLA. I design and build the next generation of **plasma accelerators**—the technology that will power future scientific tools, from compact **free-electron lasers (FELs)** to energy-frontier **particle colliders**.

## My Approach
Solving challenges at the frontier of plasma acceleration requires a comprehensive strategy. My work is built on a tight integration of three core pillars, allowing me to bridge the gap from fundamental concepts to real-world demonstrations:

* **Hands-on Experimentation:** I design, lead, and execute experiments at world-class facilities like SLAC’s FACET-II and BNL's ATF. These projects push the boundaries of accelerator technology, aiming to demonstrate the critical milestones—like building a plasma wakefield transformer for next-generation compact coherent light sources and a 10 GeV module for future multi-stage TeV plasma accelerators.
* **High-Fidelity Simulation:** I use large-scale particle-in-cell (PIC) simulations as an essential tool to design and optimize experiments, interpret physical results, and explore the complex beam-plasma dynamics that cannot be measured directly.
* **Theory and Machine Learning:** Beyond the hardware and code, I focus on developing a deep physical intuition for these systems. I also apply machine learning to create "virtual diagnostics," which extract crucial insights from complex experimental data and provide the feedback necessary to improve accelerator performance.

## Current Projects
My current research at FACET-II is focused on demonstrating the core technologies needed for future accelerators:

* **Plasma Wakefield Transformer (E304):** We are using a plasma wakefield as a "dual transformer" to simultaneously boost beam energy and brightness. This is a crucial technique for creating the high-quality beams needed for future compact light sources.
* **Plasma Accelerator Module for Colliders (E300):** I am working on a plasma module designed to double the energy of a 10 GeV beam while preserving its quality—a critical step toward building the multi-stage plasma accelerators required for an energy-frontier collider.

## Let's Connect
I'm always open to collaboration with colleagues in academia and industry. If you are interested in tackling grand challenges at the frontier of accelerator, light source, and plasma science, please get in touch.
