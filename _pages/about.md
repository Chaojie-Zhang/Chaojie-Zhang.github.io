I'm Chaojie Zhang (张超杰), an experimental plasma physicist at UCLA whose research program accelerates the realization of plasma-based energy-frontier colliders by resolving key physics bottlenecks through an integration of high-impact experiments, large-scale simulations, and AI/ML-driven modeling. My work aims to transform plasma wakefield acceleration from proof-of-principle demonstrations into the robust, reliable technology needed for next-generation particle colliders and compact light sources.

I was born and grew up in Xinzheng (新郑), the legendary birthplace of Huangdi, the Yellow Emperor and mythical ancestor of Chinese civilization. Growing up in a place steeped in such profound historical and cultural significance instilled in me a deep appreciation for humanity's endless quest for understanding—a spirit that led me to pursue science and technology. I pursued my undergraduate and doctoral studies in Engineering Physics at Tsinghua University, where I pioneered femtosecond relativistic electron probing (FREP), producing the first direct images of plasma wakefields and earning the John Dawson Thesis Prize. After completing my Ph.D. in 2016, I joined UCLA as a postdoctoral researcher and have since led multiple landmark experiments at world-class facilities including SLAC's FACET-II and Brookhaven's Accelerator Test Facility.

My approach integrates three core pillars: hands-on experimentation at DOE user facilities, high-fidelity particle-in-cell simulations on supercomputers, and AI/ML-driven diagnostics that extract insights from complex data. This comprehensive strategy allows me to address the critical challenges preventing plasma accelerators from reaching their full potential—from efficient staging architectures and positron acceleration to achieving the extreme beam brightness required for colliders.

## Research Highlights

### 🔬 High-Brightness Beam Generation (E304 at FACET-II)

**Plasma "dual transformer" for next-generation accelerators and light sources**

As Principal Investigator of the E304 experiment, I demonstrated a plasma transformer that converts a low-quality drive beam into a new beam with 2× higher energy (>20 GeV) and 10× higher brightness. This approach decouples energy boosting from quality preservation, achieving electron bunches with energy spread below 0.5% and ultrahigh brightness—meeting the stringent requirements for next-generation X-ray free-electron lasers and enabling novel staging architectures for plasma-based colliders.

**Impact:** Accepted in principle by *Nature Communications* (2025). Establishes pathway for compact plasma-driven XFELs and addresses the staging challenge for TeV-scale colliders.

### 🌌 Accelerator-Driven Plasma Physics (AE98/AE134 at BNL)

**First direct laboratory measurement of fundamental astrophysical plasma instabilities**

As Principal Investigator of the AE98 experiment at BNL's Accelerator Test Facility, I led the first direct laboratory measurement of the thermal Weibel instability—a fundamental process predicted decades ago and observed in astrophysical contexts but never directly measured in controlled conditions. Using ultrashort electron bunches as probes, we mapped the self-generated magnetic fields in laser-ionized plasmas, providing experimental validation of a process crucial to phenomena ranging from gamma-ray bursts to cosmic magnetic field generation.

**Impact:** Published in *PNAS* (2022, highlighted by DOE) and *PRL* (2020). Bridges laboratory and astrophysical plasma physics with implications for understanding extreme astrophysical environments.

### 🤖 AI/ML-Driven Virtual Diagnostics

**Physics-informed machine learning for femtosecond beam characterization**

I developed a physics-informed "virtual diagnostic" that uses machine learning to reconstruct the longitudinal phase space of femtosecond electron bunches—information that is otherwise inaccessible through direct measurement. This technique combines neural networks with physical constraints from beam dynamics, enabling complete phase space reconstruction from limited diagnostic data. This AI/ML-driven approach was critical to our recent *Nature Communications* publication and is now being adopted by collaborators across multiple experiments for advanced data analysis.

**Impact:** Enables discoveries that would otherwise be impossible. Becoming a new standard for beam diagnostics at next-generation facilities, with applications to optimizing and controlling ultra-bright beam generation.
