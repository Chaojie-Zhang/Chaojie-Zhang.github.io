Hi there! I'm Chaojie Zhang, an experimental plasma physicist at UCLA leading cutting-edge research in plasma-based particle acceleration and ultrafast plasma phenomena.

I lead experiments at some of the world's most advanced facilities, including FACET-II at SLAC and ATF-BNL, pushing the boundaries of plasma wakefield acceleration toward next-generation particle accelerators and X-ray free electron lasers.

## Research Highlights

* Developed femtosecond relativistic electron probe (FREP) for visualizing plasma wakefields
* Demonstrated >20 GeV electron acceleration with ultrahigh brightness
* Conducted direct measurements of thermal Weibel instability in laboratory plasmas

## Current Projects

**E304 at FACET-II (SLAC)**: Investigating plasma wakefield acceleration for future coherent light sources

**E300**: Working on energy doubling demonstrations in plasma accelerators for next-generation colliders

## Research Philosophy

I focus on the experimental side of physics, building setups that explore the behavior of light, matter, and extreme fields. Through projects across multiple national labs and universities, I work on understanding how researchers can collaborate effectively to address challenges in plasma and accelerator physics.

Thanks for stopping by! Whether you're interested in plasma physics, accelerator physics, or just curious about life in experimental research, feel free to reach out.
