**Abstract:** This plenary presentation introduced the groundbreaking technique of using femtosecond relativistic electron bunches to probe plasma wakefields with unprecedented temporal and spatial resolution. The talk described the inception and first experimental demonstration of femtosecond relativistic electron microscopy and its applications to wakefield visualization.

**Historical Significance:** This was one of the first presentations of the femtosecond relativistic electron microscopy technique, which has since become a widely adopted diagnostic method in the plasma acceleration community.

**Legacy:** The techniques presented in this talk have since triggered extensive follow-up research at international institutes, including ATF at BNL and the Weizmann Institute of Science.
